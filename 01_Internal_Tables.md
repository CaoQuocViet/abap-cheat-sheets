## Introduction

Internal Tables ...

- are tables that temporarily store variable data (i.e. any number of table lines of a fixed structure) in the working memory in ABAP.
- are [dynamic data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendynamic_data_object_glosry.htm), i.e. all properties apart from the memory consumption are determined statically by the [data type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendata_type_glosry.htm).
- consist of a variable sequence of lines of the same data type. 
- have a [table type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_type_glosry.htm) as its data type (it is a [complex data type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abencomplex_data_type_glosry.htm)), which defines the following properties: 
  - [line type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrow_type_glosry.htm)
  - [table category](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_category_glosry.htm)
  - [table key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_key_glosry.htm)
- are used when a variable data set of a random data type needs to be processed in a structured way, for example, storing and processing [database table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendatabase_table_glosry.htm) content within an [ABAP program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_program_glosry.htm).
- allow access to individual table lines via a [table index](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_index_glosry.htm) or a [table key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_key_glosry.htm).

## Basic Properties of Internal Tables

<details>
  <summary>Expand to view the details</summary>
  <!-- -->

**Line Type**

- Defines how each line of the internal table is set up, i. e. it describes what columns the table has.
- It can be any ABAP data type, e.g. an [elementary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenelementary_data_type_glosry.htm) or complex data type as well as a [reference type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenreference_type_glosry.htm).
- In most cases, the line type is [structured](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenstructured_type_glosry.htm). In this case, the individual components of a line are also referred to as the columns of the internal table.
- In a simple case, the line consists of a [flat structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenflat_structure_glosry.htm) with elementary data objects; however, it can also be a [deep structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendeep_structure_glosry.htm) whose components can be structures themselves or even internal tables.

**Table Category**

- Defines how internal tables are managed and stored internally, and how to access individual table entries.
- Why is it relevant? The use of a suitable table category should meet your requirements, i.e. if the internal tables are large, the different categories can have significant performance differences when accessing table content.
- Note: There are two ways to access internal tables:
   - Access by table index: A line of an internal table is accessed by its line number. This kind of access is the fastest way to access table lines.
   - Access by table key: A line of an internal table is accessed by searching for specific values in specific columns. Note: The columns in which you search can be key columns, but they can also be non-key columns.


| Category | Internally managed by | Access | Primary table key | When to use | Hints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|`STANDARD`|Primary table index (that's why these tables are called [index tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenindex_table_glosry.htm))|<ul><li>Table index</li><li>Table key</li></ul>|<ul><li>Always non-unique, i.e. duplicate entries are always allowed</li><li>Definition of an empty key is possible if the key is not relevant(`WITH EMPTY KEY`)</li></ul>|<ul><li>If you primarily access the table content for sequential processing or via the table index.</li><li>Response time for accessing the table using the primary key: This kind of table access is optimized only for sorted and hashed tables.

|`SORTED`|Primary table index (that's why these tables are called [index tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenindex_table_glosry.htm))|<ul><li>Table index</li><li>Table key</li></ul>|<ul><li>Non-unique</li><li>Unique</li><br>... used to sort the table in ascending order.</ul>|<ul><li>Enables an optimized access to table content using table key and index.</li><li>If access via table key is the main access method, but no unique key can be defined.</li></ul>|<ul><li>Sorting is done automatically when lines are inserted or deleted.

**Key Attributes** 

- There are two types of table keys: a [primary table key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenprimary_table_key_glosry.htm) and [secondary table keys](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensecondary_table_key_glosry.htm).
- Table keys ...
  - are intended to provide an optimized access to the content of internal tables.
  - are either unique or non-unique, i.e. more than one line with the same key (duplicates) can exist in the internal table or not. Regarding the primary table key, the definition depends on the table category. For the secondary table key, the definition depends on the key type. For standard tables, the primary table key can also be defined as empty, i.e. it does not contain any key columns. Note that for standard tables, an optimized access is only possible with secondary table keys.
 - Type of keys:  
   - Sorted keys: 
     - Are either the primary table keys of sorted tables or the secondary table keys of any table.
     - Are managed internally by a table index. In the case of sorted tables, this is the primary table index. In the case of secondary table keys, a secondary table index is added.
     - Access via sorted keys means an optimized binary search.
   - Hashed keys:
     - Are either the primary table key of hashed tables or secondary table keys of any table.
     - Internally managed by a hash algorithm. 
     - There is no table index for a hashed key.

## Table Keys in Internal Tables (Primary, Secondary, Standard, Empty)

<details>
  <summary>Expand to view the details</summary>
  <!-- -->

**Primary table key**

- Each internal table has a primary table key.
- Can be either a self-defined key or the [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenstandard_key_glosry.htm).
- The primary table key is ...
  - sorted for sorted tables. 
  - hashed for hashed tables.
- Note that the key fields in sorted and hashed tables are read-only. This is not valid for standard tables.
- The specification of the primary key can be omitted only for standard tables. The primary table key is then automatically defined as a non-unique standard key.
- The primary table key has the predefined name `primary_key`, by which it can also be addressed explicitly. However, its use is optional, and it is usually not necessary to specify it explicitly. You can also specify an alias name for the primary key. 
- When accessing internal tables using the table key, the primary key is always used implicitly in processing statements if no secondary key is specified. Note that the primary table key must be specified  in table expressions if the primary key is to be used explicitly.

> **💡 Note**<br>
> The key can consist of individual key fields or the entire line of the internal table. In this case, the pseudo component `table_line` can be used to denote the primary table key. For non-structured line types, this is the only way to define the key.

**Standard key**
- The [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenstandard_key_glosry.htm) is a special primary table key.
- It can be declared either explicitly or implicitly.
- Standard key of an internal table with a ...
   - structured line type: The primary table key consists of all fields with character-like and byte-like data types.
   - non-structured/elementary line type: The entire table is the key (`table_line`).
- An internal table with no explicit key specification implicitly has the standard table key as the primary table key.
- Why respecting standard keys is important:
  - Sorting of a table can produce unexpected results.
  - Since the standard key can consist of many fields, it affects the performance when accessing the internal table via the keys.
  - The key fields of the primary table key of sorted and hashed tables are always read-only, i.e. using the standard key with these table categories and then (unintentionally) modifying fields can cause unexpected runtime errors.
  - Specifying keys explicitly has the advantage of making the code more readable and preventing the standard key from being set by mistake.

**Empty key**
- The primary table key of a standard table can be empty, i.e. it does not contain any key fields.
- An empty key is not possible for sorted and hashed tables.
- When used: 
  - When the definition of a table key is not important.
  - To explicitly state that a table key is not required, instead of specifying no key definition. Otherwise, the standard key is used, which can lead to unexpected results as mentioned above.
- Declaration:
    -   Explicit declaration using the addition `EMPTY KEY`.
    -   Implicit declaration when using the standard key if a structured
        line type does not contain non-numeric elementary components or
        if an unstructured line type is tabular.
    - Note: When using an [inline declaration](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninline_declaration_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") such as `... INTO TABLE @DATA(itab) ...` in `SELECT` statements, the resulting table is a standard table and has an empty key.

**Secondary table keys**

- Secondary table keys ...
  - are optional for all table categories.
  - can be unique/non-unique sorted keys or unique hash keys.
  - have a self-defined name. An alias name can also be specified.
- A secondary table index is created internally for each sorted secondary key. This allows index access to hashed tables via the secondary table key. In this case, `sy-tabix` is set.
- When accessing internal tables using the secondary table key, the key name (or the alias if specified) must be specified. They are not selected automatically. If no secondary key is specified in a processing statement, the primary key or primary table index is always used. If you want to make use of this key in ABAP statements, for example, `READ`, `LOOP AT` or `MODIFY` statements, you must specify the key explicitly using the appropriate additions, for example, `WITH ... KEY ... COMPONENTS` or `USING KEY`.
- Use cases:
  - To improve read performance.
  - For very large internal tables (that are populated once and changed very often) 
  - Standard tables, whose primary table keys cannot be unique, can be provided with a means of ensuring that unique table entries are read. 
 - Note that defining secondary table keys involves additional administration costs (additional memory consumption). Therefore, the use of secondary table keys should be reserved for cases where the benefits outweigh the extra costs. 
- For more details, see the programming guidelines for secondary keys: [Secondary
    Key (F1 docu for standard ABAP)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abensecondary_key_guidl.htm "Guideline").

> **💡 Note**<br>
> - See examples of internal table declarations using the table keys mentioned above in the following section.
> - See an example that uses secondary table keys [below](#improving-read-performance-with-secondary-table-keys).

## Creating Internal Tables and Types

You can declare internal tables and internal table types in [ABAP programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_program_glosry.htm) using the [`TYPES`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaptypes.htm) and [`DATA`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapdata.htm) statements. The relevant syntax elements for internal tables are `TABLE OF` in combination 
with the additions [`TYPE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapdata_simple.htm)
or [`LIKE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapdata_referring.htm).

``` abap
TYPES itab_type1 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF data_type ...   "Standard table type
TYPES itab_type2 LIKE SORTED   TABLE OF data_object ... "Sorted table type

DATA  itab1      TYPE          TABLE OF data_type ...   "Standard table by default
DATA  itab2      TYPE HASHED   TABLE OF data_type ...   "Hashed table
DATA  itab3      TYPE                   itab_type1 ...  "Based on an existing internal table type 
DATA  itab4      LIKE                   itab1 ...       "Based on an existing internal table       
```

> **💡 Note**<br>
> - If the table category is not specified (`... TYPE TABLE OF ...`), it is automatically `... TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF ...`.
> - Using [Runtime Type Creation (RTTC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrun_time_type_creation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), you can define and  create new internal tables and table types as [type description objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentype_object_glosry.htm) at runtime. For more information, see the [Dynamic Programming](06_Dynamic_Programming.md) ABAP cheat sheet.

The following code snippet contains various internal table declarations. It is intended to demonstrate a selection of the rich variety of possible internal tables mentioned in the previous sections, e.g. in *Table Keys in Internal Tables*.
In the examples, the internal tables are created using the structured type of a demo database table in the DDIC. The line type of the database table is automatically used when defining an internal table.

```

As mentioned, the examples above demonstrate internal tables that are created using the structured type of a database table in the DDIC. 
The following example shows the pattern and various examples of declaring internal tables and types by including the local definition of structured data and internal table types for demonstration purposes.

Steps: 
1. Define a structured data type (locally or globally). 
   This is not necessary if you use, for example, the name of a database table or [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_view_glosry.htm) in the internal table declaration. In these cases their line type is used automatically.
2. Define an internal table type.
3. Create the internal table, i.e. a data object that uses this type.

You can also create an internal table by ...
- combining the data object creation and table type definition in one step. 
- using an [inline declaration](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninline_declaration_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Such inline declarations are possible at suitable [declaration
positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendeclaration_positions.htm)
if the operand type can be fully determined, for example, using a
`DATA` statement (or [`FINAL`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfinal_inline.htm) for immutable variables).


``` abap
"1. Defining line type locally

## Populating Internal Tables

### Copying Internal Tables

To copy internal table content from one table to another, you can use the assignment operator. Such an assignment (without a constructor expression) deletes the existing content in the target internal table. The example below assumes that the source and target table have compatible line types. Using inline declaration is helpful to avoid an additional internal table declaration with an appropriate type.

``` abap
itab = itab2.

DATA(itab3) = itab.
FINAL(itab4) = itab.
```

> **💡 Note**<br>

### Using INSERT and APPEND Statements to Populate Internal Tables

You can use the ABAP keywords
[`INSERT`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapinsert_itab.htm)
and [`APPEND`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapappend.htm)
to add lines to internal tables.

<details>
  <summary>Notes on using <code>APPEND</code> and <code>INSERT</code></summary>
  <!-- -->

-   `APPEND` ...
    -   always adds lines at the bottom of the internal table.
    -   is not a problem for standard tables where lines are managed
        by an index. When the statement is used, the system field
        `sy-tabix` is set to the index of the recently added
        line. `sy-tabix` is always set to the index with respect
        to the primary table index.
    -   cannot be used for hashed tables. For sorted tables,
        lines are appended only if they match the sort order, and no
        duplicate entries are created if the primary table key is unique.
        Therefore, `INSERT` should be used when adding lines to
        sorted tables.
-   `INSERT` ...
    -   can be used to add lines at a specific position in tables (by
        specifying the target index). In doing so, all the following
        lines are moved down one position.
    -   without specifying the position adds the lines at the bottom of
        the table in case of standard tables. However, when using
        `INSERT`, `sy-tabix` is not set unlike
        `APPEND`. In case of sorted tables, the line is
        automatically inserted at the correct position.
    - With `INSERT`, you can specify the position in the internal table at which lines are inserted after `INTO`. 
        - `... INTO TABLE itab ...`: Line is inserted in ...
          - standard tables as last line (i.e. appended) 
          - sorted tables in the sort order in accordance with primary key values
          - hashed table by the hash administration in accordance with primary key values
        - `... INTO itab INDEX n`: Possible for index tables. The line is inserted before the line with the line number `n` in the primary table index.
    -   Note: In the case of unique primary table keys, the table cannot have entries with duplicate
        keys. If a duplicate is inserted, the insertion fails and the
        system field `sy-subrc` is set to 4.
- What to use? The recommendation is the `INSERT` statement. It covers all table and key types. Consider potential issues when you change table/key types, and you use `APPEND` in your code.         
</details>
<br>

**Adding a line to an internal table**. The example shows both a structure that is created using the `VALUE` operator as well as an existing structure that is added.

``` abap
APPEND VALUE #( comp1 = a comp2 = b ... ) TO itab.
APPEND lv_struc TO itab.

INSERT VALUE #( comp1 = a comp2 = b ... ) INTO TABLE itab.
INSERT lv_struc INTO TABLE itab.
```

**Adding an initial line** to an internal table without providing any field values.

``` abap
APPEND INITIAL LINE TO itab.

INSERT INITIAL LINE INTO TABLE itab.
```

**Adding a line and assigning the added line to a field symbol or data reference variable**.
```abap
"When inserting single lines, you can specify the optional additions 
"ASSIGNING and REFERENCE INTO. If the insertion is successful, the 
"line is assigned to a field symbol or a data reference variable.
"The targets can also be created inline. 
APPEND VALUE #( comp1 = a comp2 = b ... ) TO itab ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>).
APPEND INITIAL LINE TO itab ASSIGNING <fs>.
INSERT INITIAL LINE INTO TABLE itab REFERENCE INTO DATA(dref).
```

**Adding all lines** from another internal table.

``` abap
APPEND LINES OF itab2 TO itab.

INSERT LINES OF itab2 INTO TABLE itab.
```

**Adding multiple lines from another internal table with a specified index range**.
- Both `FROM` and `TO` are not mandatory in one statement. it is possible to use only one of them. 
- If you use only ...
  - `FROM`, all lines up to the last table entry are respected.
  - `TO`, all lines starting with the first table entry are respected. 

``` abap
"i1/i2 represent integer values

APPEND LINES OF itab2 FROM i1 TO i2 TO itab.

APPEND LINES OF itab2 FROM i1 TO itab.

APPEND LINES OF itab2 TO i2 TO itab.

INSERT LINES OF itab2 FROM i1 TO i2 INTO itab.
```

**Inserting one line or multiple lines from another internal table at a specific position**. 
`FROM` and `TO` can be used here, too.

``` abap
INSERT lv_struc INTO itab2 INDEX i.

INSERT LINES OF itab2 INTO itab INDEX i.
```

### Creating and Populating Internal Tables Using Constructor Expressions
The constructor expressions can be specified in/with various positions/statements in ABAP. In most of the following snippets, simple assignments are demonstrated.

> **💡 Note**<br>
> The following sections cover a selection. There are more constructor expressions used in the context of internal tables (e.g. for creating internal tables). Find more details in the [Constructor Expressions](05_Constructor_Expressions.md) ABAP cheat sheet.

#### VALUE operator
As mentioned above, table lines that are constructed inline as
arguments to the `VALUE` operator, for example, can be added to
internal tables. In the following cases, internal tables are populated
using constructor expressions in the context of
[assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenassignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

In the example below, the internal table is populated by assigning an
internal table that is constructed inline with the `VALUE`
operator. The inline constructed table has two lines. `line`
represents an existing structure with a compatible line type. The
other line is constructed inline.


> **💡 Note**<br>
> The extra pair of parentheses represents a table line. The `#` character indicates that the line type can be derived from the context. The assignment deletes the existing content of the internal table on the left side.

``` abap
itab = VALUE #( ( line )
                ( comp1 = a comp2 = b ...  ) ).
```

**Creating an internal table by inline declaration** and adding lines with a constructor expression.
``` abap
"Internal table type
TYPES it_type LIKE itab.

"Inline declaration
"The # character would not be possible here since the line type
"cannot be derived from the context.
DATA(it_in) = VALUE it_type( ( comp1 = a comp2 = b ... )
                             ( comp1 = c comp2 = d ...  ) ).

"Creating string tables
DATA(str_tab_a) = VALUE string_table( ( `Hallo` ) ( `World` ) ).                            
DATA(str_tab_b) = VALUE string_table( ).                            
"In the previous statement, the internal table is declared
"inline, however, no content, no table lines are provided. 
"This means that an initial string table was created. This 
"way, the statement has the same effect as the following 
"statement.
DATA str_tab_c TYPE string_table.
```

When you use the above assignments (`itab = ...`), the internal table is initialized and the existing content is deleted. To add new lines **without deleting existing content**, use the  [`BASE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm) addition.

``` abap
itab = VALUE #( BASE itab ( comp1 = a comp2 = b ... )
                          ( comp1 = c comp2 = d ... ) ).
```

**Adding lines of other tables** using the `LINES OF` addition to the `VALUE` operator.
> **💡 Note**<br>
> Without the `BASE` addition, the existing content is deleted. It is assumed that the line type of the source table is compatible with that of the target table.
``` abap
itab = VALUE #( ( comp1 = a comp2 = b ...)
                ( comp1 = a comp2 = b ...)
                ( LINES OF itab2 )
                ... ).
```

#### CORRESPONDING operator

**Copying the content of another internal table** using the
[`CORRESPONDING`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expr_corresponding.htm) operator. 
- Note that the existing content is deleted.
- As an alternative to the `CORRESPONDING` operator, you can use [`MOVE-CORRESPONDING`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapmove-corresponding.htm) statements. 
- The example assumes that the line types of the source and target table are not compatible. However, if the line types are compatible, the syntax will also work.
- Several additions are possible. They can also be combined. Check the ABAP Keyword Documentation.
  
``` abap
itab = CORRESPONDING #( itab3 ).

MOVE-CORRESPONDING itab3 TO itab.
```

**Copying content and retaining existing content** using the `CORRESPONDING` operator. 
The `KEEPING TARGET LINES` addition of the `MOVE-CORRESPONDING` statement preserves the table content.

``` abap
itab = CORRESPONDING #( BASE ( itab ) itab3 ).

MOVE-CORRESPONDING itab3 TO itab KEEPING TARGET LINES.
```
**Assigning components using mapping relationships**
- You can use the `MAPPING` addition of the `CORRESPONDING` operator to specify components of a source table that are assigned to the components of a target table in mapping relationships. 
- For elementary components, the assignment is made according to the associated assignment rules.

``` abap
itab = CORRESPONDING #( itab3 MAPPING a = c b = d ).
```

**Excluding components from the assignment** using the `EXCEPT` addition to the `CORRESPONDING` operator.
- This is particularly useful if there are identically named components in the source and target tables that are not compatible or convertible. You can avoid syntax errors or runtime errors. 
- Instead of a component list, `EXCEPT` can also be followed by `*` to exclude all components that are not mentioned in a previous mapping of components. 
- If `EXCEPT *` is used without the `MAPPING` addition, all components remain initial.
``` abap
itab = CORRESPONDING #( itab3 EXCEPT e ).

itab = CORRESPONDING #( itab3 EXCEPT * ).
```

**Preventing runtime errors when duplicate lines are assigned** to the target table that is defined to accept only unique keys using the `DISCARDING DUPLICATES` addition of the `CORRESPONDING` operator. 
- In this case, the duplicate line is ignored in the source table. 
- The addition can also be specified with `MAPPING ...`.

``` abap
itab = CORRESPONDING #( itab2 DISCARDING DUPLICATES ).
```

**Copying data from deep internal tables**. 
- The `BASE` addition does not delete the existing content. 
- See also the alternative `MOVE-CORRESPONDING` statements.
``` abap
itab_nested2 = CORRESPONDING #( DEEP itab_nested1 ).

itab_nested2 = CORRESPONDING #( DEEP BASE ( itab_nested2 ) itab_nested1 ).

MOVE-CORRESPONDING itab_nested1 TO itab_nested2 EXPANDING NESTED TABLES.

MOVE-CORRESPONDING itab_nested1 TO itab_nested2 EXPANDING NESTED TABLES KEEPING TARGET LINES.
```

#### FILTER Operator

To create an internal table by copying data from another internal table and 
filtering out lines that do not meet the `WHERE` condition, you can use the [`FILTER`
operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_filter.htm).

-   The
    `FILTER` operator constructs an internal table according to a specified type (which can be an explicitly specified, non-generic table type or the `#` character as a symbol for the [operand type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenoperand_type_glosry.htm) before the first parenthesis).
- The lines for the new internal table are taken from an
    existing internal table based on conditions specified in a `WHERE` clause. Note that the table type of the existing internal table must be convertible into the specified target type.
-   The conditions can be based on either single values or a [filter
    table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expr_filter_table.htm).
- Additions:

|Addition |Details |
|---|---|
|`USING KEY`  | Specifies the [table key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") used to evaluate the `WHERE` condition: either a [sorted key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensorted_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [hash key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenhash_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If the internal table does not have either of these, it must have a [secondary table key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensecondary_table_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which must be specified after `USING KEY`.  |
| `EXCEPT`   | Specifying `EXCEPT` means that those lines of the existing table are used that do not meet the condition specified in the `WHERE` clause. If `EXCEPT` is not specified, those lines of the existing table that meet the condition are used.  |

Examples:
```abap
"FILTER on conditions based on single values
"Assumption: The component num is of type i.
DATA itab1 TYPE SORTED TABLE OF struc WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY num.
DATA itab2 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF struc WITH NON-UNIQUE SORTED KEY sec_key COMPONENTS num.
DATA itab3 TYPE HASHED TABLE OF struc WITH UNIQUE KEY num.

"The lines meeting the condition are respected.
"Note: The source table must have at least one sorted or hashed key.
"Here, the primary key is used
DATA(f1) = FILTER #( itab1 WHERE num >= 3 ).

"USING KEY primary_key explicitly specified; same as above
DATA(f2) = FILTER #( itab1 USING KEY primary_key WHERE num >= 3 ).

"EXCEPT addition
DATA(f3) = FILTER #( itab1 EXCEPT WHERE num >= 3 ).
DATA(f4) = FILTER #( itab1 EXCEPT USING KEY primary_key WHERE num >= 3 ).

"Secondary table key specified after USING KEY
DATA(f5) = FILTER #( itab2 USING KEY sec_key WHERE num >= 4 ).
DATA(f6) = FILTER #( itab2 EXCEPT USING KEY sec_key WHERE num >= 3 ).

"Note: In case of a hash key, exactly one comparison expression for each key component is allowed;
"only = as comparison operator possible.
DATA(f7) = FILTER #( itab3 WHERE num = 3 ).

"Using a filter table
"In the WHERE condition, the columns of source and filter table are compared. 
"Those lines in the source table are used for which at least one line in the filter 
"table meets the condition. EXCEPT and USING KEY are also possible.

DATA filter_tab1 TYPE SORTED TABLE OF i
  WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY table_line.

DATA filter_tab2 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF i
  WITH EMPTY KEY
  WITH UNIQUE SORTED KEY line COMPONENTS table_line.

DATA(f8) = FILTER #( itab1 IN filter_tab1 WHERE num = table_line ).

"EXCEPT addition
DATA(f9) = FILTER #( itab1 EXCEPT IN filter_tab1 WHERE num = table_line ).

"USING KEY is specified for the filter table
DATA(f10) = FILTER #( itab2 IN filter_tab2 USING KEY line WHERE num = table_line ).

"USING KEY is specified for the source table, including EXCEPT
DATA(f11) = FILTER #( itab2 USING KEY sec_key EXCEPT IN filter_tab2 WHERE num = table_line ).
```

#### NEW Operator

Using the instance operator [`NEW`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_new.htm), you can create [anonymous data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenanonymous_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), such as anonymous internal tables. You can access the lines, components or the entire data objects by [dereferencing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendereferencing_operat_glosry.htm). For more information, refer to the  [Dynamic Programming](06_Dynamic_Programming.md) and [Constructor Expressions](05_Constructor_Expressions.md) cheat sheets.

```abap
TYPES: BEGIN OF s,
          a TYPE c LENGTH 3,
          b TYPE i,
        END OF s,
        tab_type TYPE TABLE OF s WITH EMPTY KEY.

"Creating and populating an anonymous data object
DATA(dref_tab) = NEW tab_type( ( a = 'aaa' b = 1 )

INSERT VALUE s( a = 'yyy' b = 3 ) INTO TABLE dref_tab->*.
```

## Reading Single Lines from Internal Tables

There are three different ways to specify the line to read:

- by index (only index tables)
- by table keys (only tables for which a key is defined)
- by free key

The following code snippets include [`READ TABLE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapread_table.htm) statements and [table expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_expressions.htm) to read from internal tables.

### Determining the Target Area when Reading Single Lines

-   Copying a line to a data object using the addition `INTO`.
    After the copying, the line found exists separately in the internal table and
    in the data object. If you change the
    data object or the table line, the change does not affect the other.
    However, you can modify the copied table line and use a
    `MODIFY` statement to modify the table based on the modified
    table line (see below). The `TRANSPORTING` addition 
    specifies which components to copy. If
    it is not specified, all components are respected.
    ``` abap
    READ TABLE itab INTO dobj ...   "dobj must have the table's structure type

    READ TABLE itab INTO DATA(dobj_inl) ...

    READ TABLE itab INTO ... TRANSPORTING comp1 [comp2 ... ].
    ```

-   Assigning a line to a [field
    symbol](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfield_symbol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"),
    for example, using an inline declaration (`... ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>) ...`). When you then access the field symbol, it means that you access the found table line. There is no actual copying of
    content. Therefore, modifying the field symbol means
    modifying the table line directly. Note that you cannot use the 
    `TRANSPORTING` addition since the entire table is
    assigned to the field symbol.

    ``` abap
    READ TABLE itab ASSIGNING <fs1> ...                 "The field symbol must have an appropriate type.

    READ TABLE itab ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs2>) ...   "The field symbol is created inline.
    ```

-   Reading a line into a [data reference
    variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendata_reference_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    using `REFERENCE INTO`. In this case, no copying takes place. If you want to address the line, you must first [dereference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendereferencing_operat_glosry.htm) the data reference. You cannot use the addition `TRANSPORTING`.

    ``` abap
    READ TABLE itab REFERENCE INTO dref ...

    READ TABLE itab REFERENCE INTO DATA(dref_inl) ...
    ```

**Which to use then?** Since all syntax options provide the same
functionality, your use case, the
performance or readability of the code may play a role. For more information, see 
the programming guidelines for the [target
area (F1 docu for standard ABAP)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_output_guidl.htm "Guideline").
A use case for `INTO dobj` is when the table should
not be changed using the copied table line. However, copying comes
at a performance cost. Imagine that your table contains many columns or
nested components. In this case, it is better not to copy at all (although you can use 
the `TRANSPORTING` addition to restrict the fields to be copied).

<p align="right"><a href="#top">⬆️ back to top</a></p>

### Reading a Single Line by Index

The following example shows `READ TABLE` statements to read a single line from an internal table by specifying the index. You can use the addition `USING KEY` to specify a table key and thus explicitly determine the table index to use. If the table has a sorted secondary
key, the addition can be specified and the line to be read is then determined from its secondary table index. If the primary table key is
specified by its name `primary_key`, the table must be an index table, and the behavior is the same as if `USING KEY` was
not specified.
Note that the examples only show reading into a work area. Other targets are possible as shown above. 
``` abap
READ TABLE itab INTO wa INDEX i.

READ TABLE itab INTO wa INDEX i USING KEY primary_key.
```

Using a [table
expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_expressions.htm),
the read result is stored in a variable that can be declared inline.
The number in the square brackets represents the index. A line that is
not found results in an runtime error. To avoid an error, you can
use a [`TRY ... CATCH ... ENDTRY.`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaptry.htm) block.

``` abap
"In the examples, integer values are specified for the index.
DATA(lv1) = itab[ 1 ].

TRY.
  DATA(lv2) = itab[ 2 ].
  CATCH cx_sy_itab_line_not_found.
  ...
ENDTRY.

DATA(lv3) = itab[ KEY primary_key INDEX 3 ].

"Copying a table line via table expression and embedding in constructor expression
DATA(lv4) = VALUE #( itab[ 4 ] ).

"Reading into data reference variable using the REF operator
DATA(lv5_ref) = REF #( itab[ 5 ] ).
```

When you read a non-existent line using a table expression, you may not want to throw an exception. You can also embed the table expression
in a constructor expression using the `OPTIONAL` addition. This way, an unsuccessful read will not trigger the 
exception. The result returned is a line with initial values.
Alternatively, you can use the `DEFAULT` addition to return a
default line in case of an unsuccessful read operation, which can also be another table expression or constructor expression.

``` abap
DATA(line1) = VALUE #( itab[ 6 ] OPTIONAL ).

DATA(line2) = VALUE #( itab[ 7 ] DEFAULT itab[ 1 ]  ).
```

### Reading a Single Line Using Table Keys

Lines can be read by explicitly specifying the table keys or the alias names, if any.
```abap
"Example internal table with primary and secondary table key and alias names
"Assumption: All components are of type i

DATA it TYPE SORTED TABLE OF struc
  WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY primary_key ALIAS pk COMPONENTS a b
  WITH NON-UNIQUE SORTED KEY sec_key ALIAS sk COMPONENTS c d.

"Table expressions

"Key must be fully specified
line = it[ KEY primary_key COMPONENTS a = 1 b = 2 ].

"The addition COMPONENTS is optional; same as above
line = it[ KEY primary_key a = 1 b = 2 ].

"Primary key alias
line = it[ KEY pk a = 1 b = 2 ].

"Secondary table key
line = it[ KEY sec_key c = 3 d = 4 ].

"Secondary table key alias
line = it[ KEY sk c = 3 d = 4 ].

"READ TABLE statements
"Primary table key
READ TABLE it INTO wa WITH TABLE KEY primary_key COMPONENTS a = 1 b = 2.

"Alias
READ TABLE it INTO wa WITH TABLE KEY pk COMPONENTS a = 1 b = 2.

"Secondary table key
READ TABLE it INTO wa WITH TABLE KEY sec_key COMPONENTS c = 3 d = 4.

"Alias
READ TABLE it INTO wa WITH TABLE KEY sk COMPONENTS c = 3 d = 4.

"Reading a line based on keys specified in a work area
"Work area containing primary and secondary table key values; the line type
"must be compatible to the internal table
DATA(pr_keys) = VALUE struc( a = 1 b = 2 ).

DATA(sec_keys) = VALUE struc( c = 3 d = 4 ).

READ TABLE it FROM pr_keys INTO wa.

"If USING KEY is not specified, the primary table key is used.
"If it is used, the specified table key is used.
READ TABLE it FROM pr_keys USING KEY primary_key INTO wa.

READ TABLE it FROM sec_keys USING KEY sec_key INTO wa.

"Alias
READ TABLE it FROM sec_keys USING KEY sk INTO wa.
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">⬆️ back to top</a></p>

### Reading a Single Line Using a Free Key

The specified components used as keys need not be part of a table key.
``` abap
line = it[ b = 2 ].

READ TABLE it INTO wa WITH KEY b = 2.
```

Optimized read access using the `BINARY SEARCH` addition to the `READ TABLE` statement (find more details in the expandable section below):
```abap
READ TABLE itab WITH KEY ... BINARY SEARCH ...
```

<details>
  <summary>Expand to view more information and a code snippet</summary>
  <!-- -->

- `READ TABLE` without `BINARY SEARCH`: Table is accessed linearly
- `READ TABLE` with `BINARY SEARCH`: Table is accessed using a binary search 
  - Using the `BINARY SEARCH` addition is particularly more efficient for larger tables when accessing data often. 
  - The table must be sorted in ascending order based on the keys being searched. 
  - `BINARY SEARCH` is suitable for standard tables that do not have a secondary key defined and when you need to make multiple read accesses to the table (however, note the costs of a previous sorting)  
  - `BINARY SEARCH` can only be used with index tables and not with hashed tables. If the table is sorted and the read access uses a free key, the addition can only be applied when the initial part of the table key is specified. I.e. if key components are `a`, `b`, and `c`, the addition can be used by specifying `a` alone, `a` and `b`, or `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, it is just that the syntax "works", the `BINARY SEARCH` specifiation has no effect and is redundant. Syntactically not possible with `BINARY SEARCH` (for example): `b` and `c` without `a`, or any other non-key component (because it cannot be sorted according to the non-key component). 
- Depending on the number of times you need to access the internal table, it is recommended to work with sorted tables or tables with secondary keys. If you only need to read one or a few data sets, consider the administrative costs of setting up the index.
- Note: The `BINARY SEARCH` addition is not available for table expressions. If `KEY ...` is specified, an optimized search is performed by default. There are no performance differences between using the `READ TABLE` statement and table expressions.

The output of the following example, which includes multiple reads on standard internal tables using `READ TABLE` statements without `BINARY SEARCH` and with `BINARY SEARCH` demonstrates the performance gain. An excursion is included that shows read accesses in an internal table with a secondary table key.

### Addressing Individual Components of Read Lines

When reading single lines in general, you can also address individual
components of the line using the [component
selector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abencomponent_selector_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
`-` (or the [object component selector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenobject_component_select_glosry.htm) `->` or the [dereferencing
operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendereferencing_operat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
`->*` in the case of data reference variables).
``` abap
DATA(comp1) = it[ b = 2 ]-c.

READ TABLE it INTO DATA(wa) WITH KEY b = 2.
DATA(comp2) = wa-c.

READ TABLE it ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>) WITH KEY b = 2.
DATA(comp3) = <fs>-c.

READ TABLE it REFERENCE INTO DATA(dref) WITH KEY b = 2.
DATA(comp4) = dref->c.

"It is also possible to specify the dereferencing operator
"with the component selector.
DATA(comp5) = dref->*-c.

## Getting Information about Internal Tables, Table Lines, Table Types

### Checking the Existence of a Line in an Internal Table

This is relevant if you are not interested in the content of a table
line, but only want to find out whether a line exists that matches to the
index or key specifications. To do this, use a [`READ TABLE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapread_table.htm)
statement with the `TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS` addition. The
addition indicates that no actual content is to be read. If the search was
successful and an entry exists, the system field `sy-subrc` is
set to 0.

A newer way to check the existence of a line is the [predicate
function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenpredicate_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
[`line_exists( )`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenline_exists_function.htm).
This function expects a [table
expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") as an argument.
See below for more on table expressions. Note that table expressions do not set system fields.
``` abap
"Read using the key
READ TABLE it WITH KEY b = 2 TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS.

IF sy-subrc = 0.
  ...
ENDIF.

"Read using the index
READ TABLE it INDEX 1 TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS.

IF sy-subrc = 0.
  ...
ENDIF.

"Read using the key
IF line_exists( it[ b = 2 ] ).
  ...
ENDIF.

"Read using the index
IF line_exists( it[ 1 ] ).
  ...
ENDIF.
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">⬆️ back to top</a></p>

### Checking the Index of a Line in an Internal Table

If you want to find out about the index of a line in an internal table, you can also make use of the `READ TABLE` statement above. If
the line is found, the system field `sy-tabix` is set to the number of the index. Otherwise, the built-in function
[`line_index( )`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenline_index_function.htm) can be used. It returns the index of the found line or 0 if the line does not exist.

``` abap
DATA(itab) = VALUE string_table( ( `aaa` ) ( `bbb` ) ).
READ TABLE itab WITH KEY table_line = `bbb` TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS.
"2
DATA(tabix) = sy-tabix.

"1
DATA(idx) = line_index( itab[ table_line = `aaa` ] ).
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">⬆️ back to top</a></p>

### Checking How Many Lines Exist in an Internal Table

`lines( )` is another built-in function that you can use to check how many lines exist in an internal table. It returns an integer value.

``` abap
DATA(itab) = VALUE string_table( ( `a` ) ( `b` ) ( `c` ) ( `d` ) ( `e` ) ).

"5
DATA(number_of_lines) = lines( itab ).
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">⬆️ back to top</a></p>

### Getting Table (Type) Information at Runtime

Using [Runtime Type Identification (RTTI)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrun_time_type_identific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"),
you can get type information on internal tables and table types at runtime 

For more information, see the [Dynamic Programming](06_Dynamic_Programming.md) ABAP cheat sheet.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">⬆️ back to top</a></p>

## Processing Multiple Internal Table Lines Sequentially

If you are interested not only in single table lines, but in the entire
table content or in specific parts of it, you can use [`LOOP
AT`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab.htm)
statements to process table lines sequentially. As above, you
can use multiple options for target areas: work area, field
symbol, data reference. There are multiple additions to the `LOOP AT`
statements to further restrict the table content to be processed.

Simple form:
``` abap
"The target is an existing work area.
DATA wa LIKE LINE OF it.

LOOP AT it INTO wa. 
  "No addition of the loop statement; all lines are processed
  "Statements in this block are relevant for each individual table line.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"Work area declared inline
LOOP AT itab INTO DATA(wa_inl).
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"Field symbols
FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> LIKE LINE OF it.

LOOP AT it ASSIGNING <fs>.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

LOOP AT it ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs_inl>).
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"Data reference variables
DATA dref TYPE REF TO dbtab.

LOOP AT it REFERENCE INTO dref.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

LOOP AT it REFERENCE INTO DATA(dref_inl).
  ...
ENDLOOP.
```

- The order in which tables are iterated depends on the table category. 
  - Note the [`STEP`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_cond.htm#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@) addition, which is also available for other ABAP statements.  
- Index tables are looped over in ascending order by the index. 
- Hashed tables are looped in the order in which the lines were added to the table. You can also sort the table before the loop. 
- During the loop, the system field `sy-tabix` is set to the number of the currently processed table
line. This is not true for hashed tables. There, `sy-tabix` is `0`. 
- Note that if you want to work with the value of `sy-tabix`, you
should do so immediately after the `LOOP` statement to avoid possible overwriting in statements contained in the loop block.

### Restricting the Area of a Table to Be Looped Over

The additions of `LOOP` statements come into play when you want to restrict the table content to be respected by the loop because
you do not want to loop over the entire table. Note that the examples only show work areas as target objects to hold the table line read. 
Other options are possible as shown above.

``` abap
"FROM/TO: Only for index tables

"Specifying an index range
LOOP AT it INTO wa FROM 2 TO 5.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"From specified line until the end
LOOP AT it INTO wa FROM 2.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"From first line until the specified line
LOOP AT it INTO wa TO 5.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"WHERE clause: Restricting lines based on logical expression

LOOP AT it INTO wa WHERE a > 1 AND b < 4.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"No interest in the table content; only relevant system fields are populated

"Mandatory WHERE clause
LOOP AT it TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS WHERE a < 5.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"Table key specification (snippet uses example table from above)
"The specified table key affects the order in which the table lines
"are accessed and the evaluation of the other conditions.

LOOP AT it INTO wa USING KEY primary_key.
"LOOP AT it INTO wa USING KEY pk.            "primary key alias
"LOOP AT it INTO wa USING KEY sec_key.       "secondary key
"LOOP AT it INTO wa USING KEY sk.            "secondary key alias
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"STEP addition for defining the step size and the direction of the loop
"- Step size: Specified by the absolute value of an integer
"- Direction: Specified by a positive (forward loop) or negative 
"  (loop in reverse order) integer 

"Reversing the loop order using a negative integer
"Each line is read indicated by the absolute value 1
LOOP AT it INTO wa STEP -1.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"Forward loop by specifiying a positive integer
"In the example, every second line is read.
"Note: Omitting STEP means STEP 1 by default.
LOOP AT it INTO wa STEP 2.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"STEP with other additions
"The example uses the additions FROM and TO.
"Note: If the value after STEP is negative, the value
"after FROM must be greater than the value after TO.
LOOP AT it INTO wa FROM 6 TO 3 STEP -2.
  ...
ENDLOOP.
```

### Iteration Expressions

Iteration expressions with [`FOR`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfor.htm) as part of certain constructor expressions allow you to create content of an internal table by evaluating one or more source tables.

The expressions are covered in the cheat sheet [Constructor Expressions](05_Constructor_Expressions.md):
- [Iteration Expressions Using FOR](05_Constructor_Expressions.md#iteration-expressions-using-for)
- Special reduction operator `REDUCE` that is based on iteration expressions: [REDUCE](05_Constructor_Expressions.md#reduce)

<p align="right"><a href="#top">⬆️ back to top</a></p>

### Interrupting and Exiting Loops

ABAP keywords such as `CONTINUE`, `CHECK`, and `EXIT`, are available to exit and interrupt loops. Find more information in the [Program Flow Logic](13_Program_Flow_Logic.md#interrupting-and-exiting-loops) cheat sheet.

In the following example, the loop is exited using the `EXIT` statement when a certain condition is met.
```abap
DATA(str_table) = VALUE string_table( ( `a` ) ( `b` ) ( `c` ) ( `d` ) ( `e` ) ( `f` ) ).
LOOP AT str_table INTO DATA(wa).
  DATA(tabix) = sy-tabix.
  IF wa = `e`.
    EXIT.
  ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.
ASSERT tabix = 5.
```    

<p align="right"><a href="#top">⬆️ back to top</a></p>

## Operations with Internal Tables Using ABAP SQL SELECT Statements

- In ABAP, database data is buffered in a [table buffer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_buffer_glosry.htm) (internally, this happens in internal tables in the [shared memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenshared_memory_glosry.htm) of the ABAP server). 
- During read access, it is checked if the data is in the buffer, and if so, a read happens directly from there. If not, the data is first loaded into the buffer. 
- The [ABAP SQL engine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_sql_engine_glosry.htm) is involved in the read process. It processes reads and is used when tabular data is read (with a `SELECT` statement). This includes both buffered data from database tables in the table buffer and also internal tables of the current internal session. 
- Which means ABAP SQL is executed in this buffer on the ABAP server, not directly on the database.

So, ABAP SQL `SELECT` statements can be used for multiple purposes also on internal tables. The following snippets cover a selection. Find more details in the ABAP Keyword Documentation and in the [ABAP SQL cheat sheet](03_ABAP_SQL.md).

> **💡 Note**<br>
> - No deep components (nested tables, strings) are allowed. 
> - Trailing blanks of short text fields are truncated. 
> - When joining multiple internal tables, it must be ensured that the ABAP SQL engine can handle it, which means only internal tables are used (no buffered database tables), no special features like hierarchies, aggregates, subselects, etc. are used.

### Internal Tables as Target Data Objects

Adding multiple lines from a database table to an internal table using
[`SELECT`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapselect.htm),
for example, based on a condition. In the case below, the internal table
is created inline. 
``` abap
SELECT FROM dbtab
  FIELDS comp1, comp2 ...
  WHERE ...
  INTO TABLE @DATA(itab_sel).
```

Adding multiple lines from a database table using `SELECT`, for example, based on a condition when the database table has a line type that is incompatible with the internal table. The `*` character means that all fields are selected. The other examples define specific fields.
The `APPENDING CORRESPONDING FIELDS INTO TABLE` addition appends the selected data to the end of the table without deleting existing
table entries. The `INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE` addition adds lines and deletes existing table entries.
``` abap
SELECT FROM dbtab2
  FIELDS *
  WHERE ...
  APPENDING CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE @itab.

SELECT FROM dbtab2
  FIELDS *
  WHERE ...
  INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE @itab.
```

Combining data from multiple database tables into one internal table using an [inner
join](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninner_join_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
The following example uses the [`INNER JOIN`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapselect_join.htm) addition. Note that the field list includes fields from both tables. The fields are referred to using `~`.
``` abap
SELECT db1~comp1, db1~comp2, db2~comp_abc, db2~comp_xyz ...
  FROM db1
  INNER JOIN db2 ON db1~comp1 = db2~comp1
  INTO TABLE @DATA(it_join_result).
```

Populating an internal table from a database table using
[subqueries](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
The following two examples populate an internal table from a database table. In the first example, a subquery is specified in the
`WHERE` clause with the `NOT IN` addition. It checks whether a value matches a value in a set of values
specified in parentheses. The second example populates an internal table depending on data in another table. A subquery with the `EXISTS` addition is specified in
the `WHERE` clause. In this
case, the result of the subquery, which is another
`SELECT` statement, is checked to see if an entry exists in
a table based on the specified conditions.

``` abap
SELECT comp1, comp2, ...
  FROM dbtab
  WHERE comp1 NOT IN ( a, b, c ... )
  INTO TABLE @DATA(it_subquery_result1).

SELECT comp1, comp2, ...
  FROM db1
  WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 'X' FROM db2
                 WHERE comp1 = db1~comp1 )
  INTO TABLE @DATA(it_subquery_result2).

Populating an internal table from a table based on the existence of data in
another table using the [`FOR ALL ENTRIES`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenwhere_all_entries.htm) addition.

> **💡 Note**<br>
> Make sure that the internal table you are reading from is not initial. Therefore, it is recommended that you use a subquery as shown above: `... ( SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... ) ...`.

``` abap
IF itab IS NOT INITIAL.

  SELECT dbtab~comp1, dbtab~comp2, ...
    FROM dbtab
    FOR ALL ENTRIES IN @itab
    WHERE comp1 = @itab-comp1
    INTO TABLE @DATA(it_select_result).

ENDIF.

### Querying from Internal Tables
In `SELECT` statements, internal tables can also be used as data sources. 
The snippet shows adding multiple lines from an internal table to another internal table using `SELECT`. Note the alias name that must be defined for the internal table.

``` abap
SELECT comp1, comp2, ...
  FROM @itab AS it_alias
  INTO TABLE @DATA(itab_sel).
```

Using the `LIKE` addition in the `WHERE` clause to extract internal table entries matching a specific pattern.
```abap
TYPES: BEGIN OF s,
          a TYPE c LENGTH 3,
          b TYPE i,
        END OF s,
        tab_type TYPE TABLE OF s WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(itab) = VALUE tab_type( ( a = 'abc' b = 1 ) ( a = 'zbc' b = 2 )
                              ( a = 'bde' b = 3 ) ( a = 'yde' b = 4 ) ).

SELECT a, b
  FROM @itab AS it_alias
  WHERE a LIKE '%bc'
  INTO TABLE @DATA(itab_sel_like).

*A      B     
*abc    1     
*zbc    2 
```

Using the `IN` addition in the `WHERE` clause to extract internal table entries based on values specified in an operand list.
```abap
SELECT a, b
  FROM @itab AS it_alias
  WHERE a IN ('bde', 'yde', 'zde')
  INTO TABLE @DATA(itab_in).

*A      B     
*bde    3     
*yde    4 
```

Combining data from multiple internal tables into one internal table using an [inner
join](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninner_join_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). See above.

```abap
TYPES: BEGIN OF s,
          a TYPE c LENGTH 3,
          b TYPE c LENGTH 3,
          c TYPE i,
        END OF s,
        tab_type TYPE TABLE OF s WITH EMPTY KEY.
        
DATA(it1) = VALUE tab_type( ( a = 'aaa' b = 'bbb' c = 1 )
                            ( a = 'ccc' b = 'ddd' c = 1 )
                            ( a = 'eee' b = 'fff' c = 2 ) ).

DATA(it2) = VALUE tab_type( ( a = 'ggg' b = 'hhh' c = 1 )
                            ( a = 'iii' b = 'jjj' c = 1 )
                            ( a = 'kkk' b = 'lll' c = 3 ) ).

SELECT it_alias1~a, it_alias2~b
  FROM @it1 AS it_alias1
  INNER JOIN @it2 AS it_alias2 ON it_alias1~c = it_alias2~c
  INTO TABLE @DATA(it_join_result).
      
*A      B     
*aaa    hhh   
*aaa    jjj   
*ccc    hhh   
*ccc    jjj

## Sorting Internal Tables

-   Sorted tables are stored in the memory in an automatically sorted
    order, hence, they cannot be sorted explicitly with
    [`SORT`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapsort_itab.htm).
-   For standard and hashed tables, the order can be changed.
-   When using `SORT` statements, the sort order is derived either
    by the primary table key (Note: Secondary keys
    cannot be used for the sorting.) or by explicitly specifying the
    fields to be sorted by.
-   Explicit specification is the recommended way because it is
    easier to understand and can prevent unwanted sorting results,
    especially with tables with standard key.


*Sorting by primary table key*
``` abap
"Implicit sorting by primary table key and in ascending order by default
SORT itab.

"Optional additions to determine the sort order
"As mentioned above, ASCENDING is used implicitly. Here, specifying it explicitly.
SORT itab ASCENDING.
SORT itab DESCENDING.
```

The effect of sorting can have an unexpected result if you use the simple form of the statement and do not explicitly specify the keys. If an internal table has a structured line type and (perhaps inadvertently) the standard key as the primary table key, that is, all character-like and byte-like components make up the primary table key, all these components are taken into account when the table is sorted.
``` abap
"Is basically the same as it2
DATA it1 TYPE TABLE OF zdemo_abap_fli.

DATA it2 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF zdemo_abap_fli WITH DEFAULT KEY.

"Respecting the standard key when sorting
SORT it1.
```
Plus: Suppose there are only elementary numeric components in an internal table with a structured line type. In this case, sorting has no effect because the primary table key is considered empty. This is certainly also true for tables declared with `EMPTY KEY`.

*Sorting by explicitly specifying components*

You can sort by any component of the internal table. It is also possible to specify the sort order 
(even component-wise). Explicitly specifying the components has the advantage that your code is easier to understand and you can avoid unexpected results if you accidentally use `SORT` without the `BY` addition on empty and standard table keys.

``` abap
DATA it3 TYPE TABLE OF struc WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY a.

"Sorting by primary table key a
SORT itab.

"Specifying the component to sort for; here, it is the same as the key;
"this way, the sorting is easier to understand
SORT itab BY a.

"Syntax showing multiple component sorting with component-wise sort order
SORT itab BY a b ASCENDING c DESCENDING.

"Sorting respecting the entire line (e. g. in the context of tables with
"empty or standard keys)
SORT itab BY table_line.
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">⬆️ back to top</a></p>

## Modifying Internal Table Content

As mentioned above, you can modify the content of internal table lines directly in the context of `READ TABLE` and `LOOP AT` statements using field symbols and data reference variables. You can also use table expressions for direct modification. Note that the key fields of the primary table key of sorted and hashed tables are always read-only. If you try to modify a key field, a runtime error occurs. However, this is not checked until runtime.

The following examples demonstrate direct modification of recently read table lines:
``` abap
"Table declarations

DATA it_st TYPE TABLE OF struc WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY a.

DATA it_so TYPE SORTED TABLE OF struc WITH UNIQUE KEY a.

"Reading table line into target area

READ TABLE it_st ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>) INDEX 1.

READ TABLE it_so REFERENCE INTO DATA(dref) INDEX 2.

"Modification examples
"Modifying the entire table line while keeping the values of other components;
"this way is not possible for it_so because of key value change.

<fs> = VALUE #( BASE <fs> a = 1 b = 2 ).

"Modifying a single component via field symbol

<fs>-c = 3.

"Modification via dereferencing

ref->b = 4.

"Table expressions

it_st[ 1 ] = VALUE #( a = 1 b = 2 ).

it_st[ 2 ]-c = 3.

"Sorted table: no key field change

it_so[ 2 ]-d = 4.
```

> **💡 Note**<br>
> If you want to modify recently read lines in a work area, for example, within a loop (`LOOP AT INTO dobj`), you can modify the line and then use a `MODIFY` statement to modify the internal table based on this line.

[`MODIFY`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapmodify_itab.htm)
statements provide multiple ways of changing the content of single and multiple table lines by specifying the table key or a table index,
without first reading the lines into a target area.

``` abap
"Addition FROM ...; specified key values determine the line to be modified

"line: existing line including key values
MODIFY TABLE it FROM line.

"line constructed inline
MODIFY TABLE it FROM VALUE #( a = 1 b = 2 ... ).

"Respecting only specified fields with the addition TRANSPORTING
"In case of sorted/hashed tables, key values cannot be specified.
MODIFY TABLE it FROM line TRANSPORTING b c.

"Modification via index
"Note that it is only MODIFY, not MODIFY TABLE.
"Example: It modifies the line with number 1 in the primary table index.
MODIFY it FROM line INDEX 1.

"Without the addition TRANSPORTING, the entire line is changed.
"Example: It modifies specific values.
MODIFY it FROM line INDEX 1 TRANSPORTING b c.

"USING KEY addition
"If the addition is not specified, the primary table key is used;
"otherwise, it is the explicitly specified table key that is used.
"Example: It is the same as MODIFY it FROM line INDEX 1.
MODIFY it FROM line USING KEY primary_key INDEX 1.

"The statement below uses a secondary key and an index specification
"for the secondary table index. Only specific fields are modified.
MODIFY it FROM line USING KEY sec_key INDEX 1 TRANSPORTING c d.

"Modifying multiple lines in internal tables
"All lines matching the logical expression in the WHERE clause are modified
"as specified in line.
"The additions TRANSPORTING and WHERE are both mandatory; USING KEY is optional.
MODIFY it FROM line TRANSPORTING b c WHERE a < 5.
```
> **💡 Note**<br>
> - The system field `sy-subrc` is set to `0` if at least one line was changed. It is set to `4` if no lines were changed.
> - `MODIFY`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT` statements can be specified with and without the `TABLE` addition. With `TABLE` means an index access. Without `TABLE` means an access via the table key.

## Deleting Internal Table Content

You can use [`DELETE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapdelete_itab.htm) statements to delete single and multiple lines in internal tables. The following additions can be used: `USING KEY` (for specifying a table key), `FROM`/`TO` (for specifying row ranges), `STEP` (for specifying the step size), and `WHERE` (for specifying conditions).

``` abap
"-------------- Deleting via index --------------

"Example: The first line in the table is deleted.
DELETE it INDEX 1.

"If USING KEY is not used, INDEX can only be used with index tables.
"If doing so, it determines the line from the primary table index.
"If a secondary key is specified, the secondary table index is respected
"Example: same as above
DELETE it INDEX 1 USING KEY primary_key.

"Deleting an index range; FROM or TO alone can also be specified
DELETE it FROM 2 TO 5.

"-------------- Deleting via keys --------------

"The line must have a compatible type to the tables line type and
"include key values. The first found line with the corresponding keys
"is deleted.
"If the key is empty, no line is deleted.
DELETE TABLE it FROM line.

"Instead of specifying the keys using a data object ("line" above),
"the keys can be specified separately. All key values must be specified.
"Example: Respects keys from primary table index.
DELETE TABLE it WITH TABLE KEY a = 1.

"You can also specify secondary keys.
"Example: Same as above
DELETE TABLE it WITH TABLE KEY primary_key COMPONENTS a = 1.

DELETE TABLE it_sec WITH TABLE KEY sec_key COMPONENTS ...

"---------- Deleting multiple lines based on a WHERE condition ----------

"Specifying the additions USING KEY, FROM, TO is also possible.
DELETE it WHERE a < 6.

"Excursion: Deleting in a LIKE-like fashion you may know from
"ABAP SQL statements.
"The LIKE addition is not available for the WHERE clause in DELETE
"statements for internal tables as is the case for ABAP SQL DELETE statements.
DATA(str_table) = VALUE string_table( ( `abcZ` ) ( `Zdef` ) ( `gZhi` ) 
                                      ( `Zjkl` ) ( `Zmno` ) ( `pqrZ` ) ).    

"You can, for example, use logical operators such as CP (conforms to pattern)
"All lines that begin with Z are to be deleted.
DELETE str_table WHERE table_line CP `Z*`.
"Result: abcZ / gZhi / pqrZ

"---------- Deleting the current line inside a LOOP statement ----------

"The following example illustrates deleting the current table line
"using a DELETE statement within a LOOP statement. Lines with even
"numbers are deleted.
"Note:
"- The short form of the DELETE statement always deletes the
"  current first line implicitly. It is only possible within a LOOP
"  statement and the delete operation is performed on the same internal
"  table.
"- The field symbol (or reference variable) should not be used after
"  the DELETE statement any more.
DATA itab1 TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
itab1 = VALUE #( ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ).

LOOP AT itab1 ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>).
  IF <fs> MOD 2 = 0.
    DELETE itab1.
  ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.

*Table content:
*1
*3
*5
*7
*9

"The following, similar example (uneven numbers are deleted) uses a
"table which is looped over by specifying the addition USING KEY.
"In this case (using LOOP ... USING KEY ...), the short form of the
"DELETE statement cannot be used. Use the DELETE statement with the
"addition USING KEY loop_key to delete the current first line.
"loop_key is a predefined name to be used with DELETE and within
"loops that specify LOOP ... USING KEY .... No other key name is
"possible here.
DATA itab2 TYPE TABLE OF i WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY table_line.
itab2 = VALUE #( ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ).

LOOP AT itab2 USING KEY primary_key REFERENCE INTO DATA(dref2).
  IF dref2->* MOD 2 <> 0.
    DELETE itab2 USING KEY loop_key.
  ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.

*Table content:
*2
*4
*6
*8
*10
```

### Deleting Adjacent Duplicate Lines

`DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES` statements allow you to delete all adjacent lines except for the first line that have the same content in certain components. You usually need to perform some appropriate sorting before using these statements.
``` abap
"Implicitly using the primary table key
DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM it.

"Deletion respecting the values of the entire line
DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM it COMPARING ALL FIELDS.

"Only lines are deleted with matching content in specific fields
DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM it COMPARING a c.

"Deletion respecting a specified table key
"Same as first example above
DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM it USING KEY primary_key.

DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM it USING KEY sec_key.
```

> **💡 Note**<br>
> The system field `sy-subrc` is set to `0` if at least one line has been deleted. It is set to `4` if no lines were deleted.

### Deleting the Entire Internal Table Content

The 
[`CLEAR`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapclear.htm)
and
[`FREE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapfree_dataobject.htm)
statements allow you to delete the entire table content.

The difference between the two is in the handling of the memory space originally allocated to the table. When a table is cleared with `CLEAR`,
the content is removed, but the memory space initially requested remains
allocated. If the table is populated again later, the memory space is still
available, which is a performance advantage over 
clearing an internal table with `FREE`. Such a statement also
deletes the table content, but it also releases the memory
space. 
Note that an assignment using the `VALUE` operator without entries in the parentheses clears the internal table. 

``` abap
CLEAR it.

"This statement additionally releases memory space.
FREE it.

"Assignment using the VALUE operator without entries in the parentheses
it = VALUE #( ). 

"The same applies to data reference variables pointing to internal tables.
it_ref = NEW #( ).
```

## Grouping Internal Tables

To group internal tables, there are additions for `LOOP AT` statements.

`LOOP AT ... GROUP BY` 
- Groups the lines of internal tables based on a group key. Each group key represents a group, and the lines read are members of that group. 
- Performs a loop across these groups. 
- You can execute a nested loop across the members of each group using `LOOP AT GROUP` statements.
- The statements offer a variety of syntax options, such as the following. For more information, refer to the ABAP Keyword Documentation:

  - `ASCENDING`/`DESCENDING` additions to specify the sort order in the group loop. You can also sort beforehand with `SORT` statements. 
  - `WITHOUT MEMBERS`: This creates groups (requiring group key binding) without assigning actual component values. Access to group lines is not possible. Use this when access is not necessary and you want to enhance read performance. 
  - Specifying the group key after `GROUP BY` 
    - This can be a single data object or multiple keys within parentheses, which define a structure with specific components. 
    - In simple cases, component values of the table line can be assigned to the group key or the components of the group key. However, expressions are also possible on the right side of the group key assignments. 
    - Storing group-specific information in structured group keys.     
      - `GROUP SIZE` to count group members, e.g., `gs = GROUP SIZE`. 
      - `GROUP INDEX` to index group members, e.g., `gi = GROUP INDEX`. 
      - You can choose component names (such as `gs` and `gi` in the previous example) freely. 
      - To use these components, you need a group key binding. 
  - Group key binding 
    - Can be specified at the end of the statement using `INTO` and a data object. You can also use data references (`REFERENCE INTO`) or field symbols (`ASSIGNING ...`). 
    - If specified, the current key's group key is assigned to the specified data object (data reference, or field symbol). You can then address the group in nested loops with `LOOP AT GROUP`. 
    - Note: You can access the read result (e.g., `dobj` in `LOOP AT itab INTO dobj`), but the component values are initial when the group key binding is specified. You can address the group and its component values in nested loops with `LOOP AT GROUP`. 
    - If you do not specify the group key binding, it defaults to a representative binding. In each loop pass, the first line of the current group is assigned to the target area. You can process this *representative* further in nested loops with `LOOP AT GROUP`. With representative binding, the `sy-tabix` value is set as if the loop was specified without grouping.

`LOOP AT GROUP`: 
- Allows for a nested loop across group members. 
- Only applicable with `LOOP ... GROUP BY` statements (provided `WITHOUT MEMBERS` is not specified) 
- After using `LOOP AT GROUP`, you can specify ... 
  - the read result that serves as a representative in representative binding: `LOOP AT it INTO DATA(wa) GROUP BY ... LOOP AT GROUP wa ...`. 
  - the group key binding: `LOOP AT it INTO DATA(wa) GROUP BY ... INTO DATA(gkb). ... LOOP AT GROUP gkb ...`. 
- Additional syntax options like a `WHERE` condition and further grouping are also available.

More information:
- [ABAP Keyword Documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_group_by.htm)   
- Iteration expressions can also handle table grouping (`FOR ... IN GROUP`). For example, see the [Constructor Expressions](05_Constructor_Expressions.md) cheat sheet.
- [Internal Tables: Grouping](11_Internal_Tables_Grouping.md) cheat sheet 

The example class below demonstrates internal table grouping options. To try it out, create a demo class named `zcl_some_class` and paste the following code into it. After activation, choose *F9* in ADT to execute the class. The example is designed to display results in the console.

### Improving Read Performance with Secondary Table Keys

The following example creates two demo internal tables. One without a secondary
table key and the other with a secondary table key. Consider a scenario where you
have an internal table without a secondary table key, and you want to add a secondary table key later to improve read performance. The tables are populated with a lot of data. Then, in a `DO` loop, many reads are performed on the internal tables. One example uses a free key for the read, the other uses a secondary table key that includes the components used for the free key search. Before and after the reads, the current timestamp is stored in variables, from which the elapsed time is calculated. There should be a significant delta of the elapsed time.

### Example: Exploring Read Access Performance with Internal Tables

- The following example explores the performance of read accesses to internal tables of various kinds in a simplified and self-contained manner. 
- It primarily addresses the scenario of large internal tables that are accessed frequently. 
- Read accesses are executed using `READ TABLE` statements, which access the tables by: 
  - Index (both primary and secondary table index) 
  - Key (primary table key, secondary table key, free key)
- To try this, create a demo class named `zcl_some_class` and insert the provided code. After activation, choose *F9* in ADT to execute the class. It may take some time to finish and display the output. The example is set up to display the results of the read performance test in the console.

> **💡 Note**<br>
> - This example is used for [exploration and experimentation ⚠️](./README.md#%EF%B8%8F-disclaimer). It is solely for demonstration purposes, and it is **not** a *tool* for proper and accurate runtime and performance testing. Due to its simplified nature, the results may not be entirely accurate. However, multiple test runs should reflect the notes below. 
> - The example concentrates on a few demo internal tables, constructed using various declaration options. 
> - The purpose of this example is to underscore the significance of choosing the right table categories for your internal tables, tailored to your specific use case and the frequency of table access.

Notes on ...

... primary table key and primary table index: 
- Each internal table has a primary key, which can be custom-defined or use the standard key. In standard tables, it is also possible to use an empty key. 
  - Be aware of the implications of specifying the standard key, either intentionally or unintentionally. The standard key combines all character-like components, such as `txt` in the example below, while the remaining components are of type `i`.
  - The primary key of a table is ... 
    - a hash key in hashed tables, 
    - a sorted key in sorted tables, 
    - always non-unique in standard tables. 
- Key access is optimized for hashed and sorted tables, but not for standard tables. 
  - You cannot modify key fields in hashed and sorted tables. 
  - In standard tables, key access is not optimized regarding the primary table index (for the secondary table index, it is optimized) because the search is linear. 
- Generally, the larger the table, the slower the key access. The benefit of hash tables is that they offer constant access time, even for very large tables.
- Sorted and standard tables have a primary table index, hence their designation as index tables. 
- The primary table index assigns a unique line number to each table line. 
  - The index updates whenever a line is added or removed. 
  - Unlike key access, access time via the index does not increase linearly with table size.

... secondary table key and secondary table index:
- Secondary table keys, which can be sorted or hashed, are available for all table categories. 
- They enhance table access efficiency and performance. 
- Declaring a secondary table key generates a corresponding secondary table index. However, the index for a non-unique key does not update immediately upon adding or deleting a line. The update happens when the internal table is accessed using the secondary table key. 
- In ABAP statements, you must specify the secondary table key explicitly. Otherwise, the primary table key is used implicitly. 
- Data access using the secondary table key is always optimized, even for standard tables. Thus, even older standard tables can gain from optimized access by adding secondary table keys later, without impacting existing table-related statements. 
- However, weigh the administrative costs of secondary table keys. Use them only in scenarios where they offer substantial benefits, like large internal tables that are filled once and rarely altered. Frequent modifications can lead to regular index updates, potentially impacting performance.

... the use of table categories:
- Standard tables: 
  - Suitable for ... 
    - small, sequentially accessed tables that are often accessed by index 
    - tables where sorting is not critical. However, you can explicitly sort using `SORT` statements, especially after table population.
    - tables that are populated frequently, as there is no need to check for unique entries regarding the primary table key. 
  - Access speed: 
    - Fast: By index, optimized key access with secondary table keys, and free keys using `READ TABLE ... BINARY SEARCH` statements (Note: It is recommended to use secondary table keys for an optimized access.)
    - Slow: Primary table and free key

- Sorted tables: 
  - Suitable for ...
    - large tables requiring consistent sorted content 
    - tables frequently accessed both by index and in sequence 
  - Access is fast by index, primary table key (always optimized), secondary table key (also optimized)

- Hashed tables: 
  - Suitable for ...
    - very large tables that are filled once and rarely altered 
    - tables where key-based access is the primary method 
    - tables that do not require index access on the primary table index 
  - Access is ... 
    - fast and optimized for both primary and secondary table keys 
    - consistent for large internal tables due to a special hash algorithm

### Searching and Replacing Substrings in Internal Tables with Character-Like Data Types

You can use [`FIND ... IN TABLE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapfind_itab.htm) statements to search for substrings in internal tables (standard tables without secondary table keys; with character-like line type) line by line. 

``` abap
DATA(str_table) = VALUE string_table( ( `aZbzZ` ) ( `cdZze` ) ( `Zzzf` ) ( `ghz` ) ).

"Finding all occurrences in a table
"Note: res_tab is of type match_result_tab 
"You can also restrict the search range in an internal table; see an example in REPLACE ... IN TABLE

"1. line: 1, offset: 1, length: 1, submatches: (initial)
"2. line: 1, offset: 4, length: 1, ...
"3. line: 2, offset: 2, length: 1, ...
"4. line: 3, offset: 0, length: 1, ...

"Finding the first occurrence in a table
"Note: res_struc, which is declared inline here, is of type match_result

### Ranges Tables

- Internal tables that have the predefined columns `SIGN`, `OPTION`, `LOW`, and `HIGH` 
  - `SIGN`: type c with length 1; indicates whether each line is included ('I') or excluded ('E') from the result set.
  - `OPTION`: type c with length 2; specifies the selection option for the condition. It uses comparison operators such as `EQ`, `NE`, `GE`, `GT`, `LE`, `LT`, `CP`, `NP`, `BT`, `NB`. Special rules apply for certain operators such as when using `CP` or `NP`, the `LOW` and `HIGH` columns must be character values.
  - `LOW`: The lower comparison value.
  - `HIGH`: The higher comparison value.
- Declared with the `TYPE RANGE OF` addition in `DATA` and `TYPES` statements 
- Used to store range conditions that can be evaluated in expressions using the `IN` operator (each row in the table represents a separate comparison)

```abap
"Populating an integer table with values from 1 to 20
TYPES int_tab_type TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(inttab) = VALUE int_tab_type( FOR x = 1 WHILE x <= 20 ( x ) ).

"Declaring a ranges table

                                   ( low = 12 high = 15 )
                     option = 'GE' ( low = 18 ) ).

"Using a SELECT statement and the IN addition to retrieve internal table
"content based on the ranges table specifications
SELECT * FROM @inttab AS tab
    WHERE table_line IN @rangestab
    INTO TABLE @DATA(result).
